## Fix Summary: Little Penguin Linux Kernel Module

- **License**  
   Changed invalid `"LICENSE"` to `"GPL"` for proper kernel module licensing.

- **Return Value in `init`**  
   Fixed `misc_register` return logic to correctly propagate success/failure.

- **Cleanup Function**  
   Added `misc_deregister()` in `myfd_cleanup()` to properly unregister the device.

- **Memory Allocation**  
   Allocated `tmp` with `kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE)` and added a null check to prevent crashes.

- **String Reversal Logic**  
   Corrected reversed copy loop to avoid unsigned underflow by using `t > 0` and `t - 1`.

- **User Copy in `read`**  
   Replaced `simple_read_from_buffer()` with `copy_to_user()` for correct use with dynamically allocated memory and added error handling.

- **Bounds Check in `write`**  
   Added size check and used `PAGE_SIZE - 1` in `simple_write_to_buffer()` to prevent buffer overflow.

- **Null Termination**  
   Ensured the string is properly null-terminated using the actual `res` returned from `write`.

- **Header Includes**  
   Added `<linux/uaccess.h>` to support `copy_to_user()` and `copy_from_user()`.

- **Code Style and Clarity**  
   Removed unnecessary pointer indirection, improved formatting, and made code more readable and idiomatic.
